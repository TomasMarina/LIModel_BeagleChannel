The aim of this work is to develop a carbon flow model for the pelagic ecosystem of the Beagle Channel (sub-Antarctic, Argentina) in a spring situation, focusing on two contrasting sites: the inner (western) and outer (eastern) channel.

This is a research in the framework of CoastCarb project (https://coastcarb.eu), led by members of the Work Package (WP) 2.
