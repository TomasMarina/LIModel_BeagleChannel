# Carbon fluxes and bentho-pelagic link in the western Antarctic peninsula

## Introduction


The western Antarctic Peninsula has been one of the fastest warming regions of the planet [@Turner2014; @Turner2016]

Glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses and sea-ice reduction are important effects [@Barnes2016a] that produces sedimentation changes in light and salinity.

Most work on polar secondary production focuses on water column zooplankton such as copepods and euphausiids, but coastal seabeds can be very productive as well [@Fillinger2013;@Barnes2016a].

Several studies have suggested that benthic production and immobilization of carbon could become an negative feedback to climatic change in polar coastal areas [@Barnes2017], it is very difficult to quantify all the carbon gains and losses that happen in the carbon pathway.  	

In shelf areas with depths until 500 mts the main producer and source of carbon to zoobenthos is phytoplankton, but a considerable amount of primary production is the result of macroalgal growth in shallow coastal areas, most of the production of macroalgae is exported and could be sequestered in marine sediments and constitutes another possible sink of carbon. 

Our questions are, 

- Is the export of macroalgae more important than zoobenthos in the production and possible sequestration of carbon?
- Which is the main source of carbon for zoobenthos, imported pelagic or local benthic?  
- are Antarctic coastal systems becoming a carbon sink when most of the carbon gains and losses were accounted? 

To answer these question we perform a detailed study of carbon flows in a small fjord, the Potter Cove ecosystem. This is one of the most studied sites in all Antarctica so it will represent a case study from which we could improve the predictions about the presence of negative feedbacks in coastal antarctic ecosystems.

## Methods

### Bacterial standing stocks

Bacterial activity was not correlated with Chl (as in some of our individual regional or yearly datasets) and did not immediately respond to the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Gerlache Strait. Bacterial biomass was <2% of the total plankton biomass and BP was ~3% of the co-occurring PP.

Then, the total bacterial counts mentioned in that paper (1 E08 cells/L) are similar in average to the preliminar counts Edy obtained several years ago. Those counts were not finished for all the samples taken and not confirmed, and so far never published. But in average we could say that prokaryotes are present in the water column at an order of E08 cells/L. This number changes with location, season, depth, year, currents, stream waters input, glaciar meltwater, etc, but in average we could use that number. Now, in Ducklow's paper they used the widely cited conversion factor of 10 fg carbon per cell to convert bacterial abundance to carbon biomass. We think that 10 fg C/cell is too high, as cells are small in environments like PC waters.

I found this information:

From: The ISME Journal (2010) 4, 427–439; doi:10.1038/ismej.2009.116; published online 26 November 2009-High-resolution imaging of pelagic bacteria by Atomic Force Microscopy and implications for carbon cycling. Francesca Malfatti1, Ty J Samo1 and Farooq Azam1

Of the live AFM bacterial population, 80% had a C content <10 fg per cell including 50% with <5 fg per cell, whereas 12% had a very high C content of >31 fg per cell. In sharp contrast, EFM showed the virtual absence of cells in the <5 fg C per cell and >31 fg C per cell classes. The high frequency of the <5 fg C per cell class in live AFM is difficult to explain, and the occurrence of bacteria with such a small C content merits further study. These <5 fg C cells comprise only 17% of the total assemblage C. It is also noteworthy that EFM appears to underestimate the volumes of >31 fg C cells. This size-class of cells (12% of total) was estimated to contain 49.7% of the total assemblage C by live AFM and only 2.1% by EFM.

Therefore, I'd use an average conversion factor of 5 fg C per cell, with an average cell count of 1 E08 cells/L, that would give us an estimate of 5 E08 fg C/L (0,1 ug C per Liter of seawater). Hope this is right, correct me if not please!

the estimated range is from 1 E06 a 1 E09 cells/L (Susana Vazquez & Walter Mác Cormack personal communication)

But, that is carbon in total bacterial biomass, how much of that correspond to BP coupled to PP, I don't know. 



## Discussion 


Macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean [@Krause-Jensen2016]
