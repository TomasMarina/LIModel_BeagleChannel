## Description

* Boxes: the boxes represent the main biggest compartments for the carbon flow. We are limited by model complexity and data availability: e.g. for  scavengers we don't have standing stocks thus is better to eliminate the scavengers box and incorporate them conceptually into the arrow. If we have a lot of boxes the model is more complex and it is more difficult to estimate the missing parts, I mean the estimations will have a big variance.   

* Flows and standing stocks: 

		* The units should be g Carbon by Area, by unit of time for flows.

		* We have to extrapolate all to the whole potter cove so the habitat distribution have to be taken into account. This have to be documented in detail. 
		
		* If the procedures to obtaining data are described we need the citation, if not we need a detailed text with methods.  
		
		* All these are available for summers we need an estimation of the values for winter
