[@Norkko2007] Trophic structure of coastal Antarctic food webs associated with changes in sea ice and food supply.

The role of detritus in the structure and function of food webs was recognized by early ecologists (e.g., Elton 1927, Lindeman 1942). Indeed, the vast majority of primary production at highly productive locations is not consumed by herbivores, but is returned to the ecosystem as detritus and incorporated through detri- tivores (Hairston and Hairston 1993, Polis and Strong 1996), thus increasing system stability and persistence (Moore et al. 2004). Our results indicate detritus may provide higher trophic levels with a more constant food supply, and thus dampen seasonality. 

The coupling between strong seasonality in primary production and the dampening effect of detritus, which suggest a strong influence of bottom-up control, could contribute to the high levels of omnivory exhibited by Antarctic inverte- brates. Studies from the West Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf indicate persistent detrital ‘‘food banks’’ in the sediments, which may provide benthic animals with a continuous food supply; however, continued climatic warming may rapidly increase microbial remineralization, thus reducing the food availability to detritivores (Mincks et al. 2005).

It seems reasonable that omnivory is a beneficial trait in Antarctica, as it allows for more responsive and flexible utilization of food sources that may be temporally and spatially constrained and unpredictable. While the amount of energy or level of productivity can have major impacts on community and ecosystem processes, clarifying how this may operate is not straightforward. Consequences of increased productivity and the relative balance of top-down and bottom-up control on trophic dynamics depend on how productivity interacts with factors such as habitat structure, disturbance, oceanography, population size structure, and species’ natural history (Dayton et al. 1974, Dayton 1989, Persson et al. 1996, Menge et al. 1997).

In Antarctica, the limiting relationship between sea ice distribution and in situ primary productivity emphasizes the role of connectivity and spatial subsidies of organic matter in fueling the food web. However, due to high degrees of omnivory and the prominent role of detritus, links between primary productivity and the food web are not straightforward. Polis et al. (1997) highlighted the role of spatial subsidies for marine food web dynamics where in situ primary productivity is constrained or absent (e.g., the deep sea). Indeed, spatial subsidies of both live plant material (phytoplankton, sea ice algae) and detritus appear to be especially important in fueling the base of the food web in coastal regions of Antarctica.

sea ice contains a diatom and microbial community (SIMCO) that represents a pool of organic matter that is seasonally more consistent, although of relatively small magnitude.
These data demonstrate the key role of SIMCO in ecosystem functioning in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice extent and nearshore secondary productivity. While SIMCO provides a stabilizing subsidy of organic matter, changes to sea ice coverage associated with climate change would directly affect secondary production and stability of benthic food webs in Antarctica.


[@Barnes2016a]

The high annual mortality found in shallow polar benthos was as expected, but the fact that ice scour only directly caused 58–26% of 5–25 m fauna was surprisingly low (see Barnes & Souster, 2011). It seems likely that specific predators, such as sea spiders and nudibranchs, and general grazers such as echinoids, have a bigger impact on populations than suspected.

These show that even similar scours can recover in differing ways and paces, but the current study shows that iceberg impacts have considerable impact on standing stocks of carbon.

Colonization and recolonization of the seabed by benthos, and the subsequent growth, involve massive consumption of microalgae, thereby cycling and accumulating millions of tonnes of carbon. This

[@Stammerjohn2008]

Changes in ice season duration are caused mostly by changes in autumn sea-ice advance and to a lesser degree
the spring sea-ice retreat. The largest anomalies towards a somewhat earlier retreat and a much later advance co-occur with strong northerly winds during with la Niña and/or +SAM.

phytoplankton in Antarctic waters provide the main source of dissolved organic carbon for bacterial growth 23 .

On the other hand, these findings, together with the potential contribution of macroalgae to carbon dynamics in Potter Cove, reinforces the previous hypothesis by Schloss (1997) suggesting that the main energy source sustaining the profuse biomass stock of benthic filter feeders present in the sediments (Tatian et al., 2004) may be explained by macroalgal POC inputs. More research is needed on the above topics to assess the origin and fate of POC and DOC in the context of ecosystem processes.


[@Graeve2008]

We hypothesise that the shallow benthic ecosystem in Potter Cove is not only fuelled by local pelagic primary production but also by benthic primary production in form of micro- and macro-algae. The absence of bacterial tracers in the particulate matter was striking suggesting only small contributions of bacterial biomass, whereas bacterial activities are important in sediments. This study is the first approach to reveal food web structure and energy pathways in the Potter Cove and showed the necessity to extend studies on other ecosystems compartments as well as to intensify investigation of seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of this ecosystem.


[@Iken1997] Grazing by the Antarctic fish Notothenia coriiceps: evidence for selective feeding on macroalgae

In Potter Cove, King George Island, Antarctica, macroalgae provide a significant food resource for herbivores. The demersal fish Notothenia coriiceps feeds on macroalgae. Eighteen algal species were identified in stomach contents: two chlorophytes, ten rhodophytes and six phaeophytes. Among these the rhodophyte Palmaria decipiens, the phaeophyte Desmarestia menziesii and the chlorophyte Monostroma hariotii comprised the greatest proportions of algal biomass. A food selection study showed four algae to be preferred (P. decipiens, M. hariotii, D. menziesii, Iridaea cordata) and two species to be avoided (Desmarestia anceps and Himantothallus grandifolius) by N. coriiceps. The present investigation indicates that this fish feeds not only intentionally, but also selectively, on macroalgae. Preference for particular algal species is not related to associated epifaunal biomass or to associated amphipod biomass.

[@Ducklow2015] Ecological controls on biogeochemical fluxes in the western Antarctic Peninsula studied with an inverse foodweb model

Saba et al. [25] analyzed a twenty-year time series of
climate, sea ice, chlorophyll (Chl) and physical oceanographic
observations from permanent nearshore sampling stations at
Palmer Station (64.77 o S, 64.05 o W). They demonstrated that
positive anomalies in phytoplankton and bacterial blooms
occurred in years with increased winter ice extent and
duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water
column stability in summer. Significant positive summer
(December—February) Chl anomalies at Palmer Station were
observed in 1996, 2002, 2006 and 2010. Analyses of penguin
diet composition revealed that successful krill recruitment
only occurred during the high-Chl years. Thus the WAP
ecosystem is characterized by a pattern wherein physical
conditions supporting large phytoplankton blooms, successful
krill recruitment and enhanced food availability for foraging
penguins occur every 4—6 years, separated by several years
of low phytoplankton abundance, poor or nonexistent krill
recruitment and less food for penguins.
