Here some comments:

1) I added a benthic microfauna compartment. It consumes microphytobenthos and represents an energy source for meiofauna and deposit feeders. Furthermore, microfauna can be transferred to filter and deposit feeders via attachment to sediments and resuspended sediments.
2) I separated bacteria in two compartments: attached and free. 
3) Attached bacteria are linked to microphytobenthos (via nutrient recycling), suspended sediments and microfauna (as a food source). 
4) Free bacteria are imported and locally produced and are linked to microzooplankton (as a food source) and to phytoplankton (via local nutrient recycling).
5) I added to the Papers folder an interesting publication from Renaud et al. 2007 to highlight  the importance of microfauna.

I had a look at the Carbon Budget conceptual scheme, and I briefly discussed it with Ulrike too.

My comments are:

-Import and Export should be better specified, since we need to know whether we are talking about Organic carbon (POC or DOC) or DIC (it is confusing to me that import goes both to Primary producers, bacteria and to Salps)

- the Primary producers are there all together and sediment is down below, meiofauna too, suspended sediment on the right of the drawing...I would find more logic and easy to visualise if we would keep the 2D structure of the environment with top part the water column and bottom the benthos and in this fashion show the benthic-pelagic coupling for the C budget

- in the plankton realm I miss all the intermediate size zooplankton (we move from microzooplankton to krill/salps)

-Deposit feeders usually don't feed on microphytobenthos unless we consider it as indirect passive feeding

-Filter feeders can as well filter on  microphytobenthos (e.g. the bivalve Mysella charchoti)

-Scavengers don't feed on macroalgae detritus

-Meiofauna do feed on microphytobenthos

-Sediment here seems to me to be intended as Sediment Organic Matter (sediment is an inorganic feature if not specified)

-Attached bacteria??? What would this mean?

These are my initial comments. I hope soon there will be some text to describe this or at least that we can start working on the paper concept together. If possible to have the ppt of the scheme I could also work it a bit instead of these text comments.

"Hi Fra, would have to disagree with you on a couple of points;

1) -Deposit feeders usually don't feed on microphytobenthos unless we consider it as indirect passive feeding

   Without isotope or fatty acid labelling it would be hard to prove but they seem to at Rothera and Signy in deep water as well as shallows.. 

2) -Filter feeders can as well filter on  microphytobenthos (e.g. the bivalve Mysella charchoti)
   Yes but as far as I know only if its suspended through current or iceberg action.  Surely Mysella is a deposit feeder?

3) -Scavengers don't feed on macroalgae detritus

We have definitely observed many scavenging amphipods and isopods switch to feeding on shredded algae after storms at Rothera.

1) split Phytoplankton into micro, nano and pico.  a) i) vast bulk of it is micro and not much breaks it down so mostly through microbial loop. ii) nano v important to most suspension feeding animals.  Iii) pico dwarfed by larger sizes in spring/summer but much more important in winter (probably).  b) a lot of import and export on varying time scales but v important in heavy sea ice years..

2)  I would have separate boxes for gelatinous ZooP and crustacean zooP (+ how important are pteropods there?), do quite different jobs in different ways.

3) I don’t see any need to split macro and mega benthos – personally I would split into 12 functional groups but I can see that being unpopular so a compromise might be – a) deposit feeders, b) suspension feeders, c) scavengers and opportunistic predators , d) obligate predators [e) parasites if there are many).  Thus two boxes become four.  For energy and food web this would be fine.  In terms of carbon deposition I think it would need to be split further as it is very important whether they are shelled/skeletal or not and what lifestyle/habitat they have in terms of burial potential.

4) On the diagram only i) detritus is buried and ii) POC/DOC and ‘L ver’ are exported?   i) I think burial is a larger bracket that includes whole suspension feeders and some deposit feeders (a small component in Potter Cover, but v important in deeper water of Bransfield Strait and WAP shelf).  ii) zooP are imported and exported tidally, daily etc, as are scavengers and predators, as well as the larvae of deposit feeders and suspension feeders (plus a few of the adults).  A single iceberg scour will draw in scavengers from much further afield than Potter Cove itself.
 
Is there a plan to a) scale the size (width) of the arrows by energy/carbon / importance?  b) put names to the dominant species in each box?  c) change these names across a time period eg 1998, now and predicted 2100?
 
Minor
POC/DOC will be two way (arrows) with some zooP and suspension feeding benthos
Add –i) arrows from detritus to IBME, IB MA and EB MA (I agree it requires prokaryote breakdown for [most but not all] photosynthetic material but detritus also has much dead animal material that is eaten directly, ii) indirect dotted line from MAA to IB MA + IB ME
Diagram shows direct arrows from SIA to IBME, IB MA and EB MA (whereas I think 99+% would have to be through prokaryotic breakdown)
 
Does this help?

The last figures were  uploaded by Leo and Francesca  in February and differ by one very important point,  note that phytoplankton is  not feeding into anything directly.. not even into epibenthic filter feeders in the last figure by Fran.

And I think that you could be right there, that phyto supplies only a very minor proportion of food to the benthos... contrary bioturbate benthos enhances remineralization and feeds the plankton with nutrients and the MPB

My concept would be that  coastal coves  under melt impact are largely driven by benthic productivity? Benthic primary prod biomass standing   is much higher than plankton in Potter. This is my guess.

in Marian Cove where water is clearer and there are much less macroalgae present we saw complete coverage by big filter feeders. So  is this an indication that phytoplankton can potentially be important?  In Young Ahn has just put out a paper where she says that benthic diatoms growing over tunicates and sponges (we also see this) can be a food source to the benthos...

this would speak for carbon cycling largely happening at the bottom..

We can put numbers to the green boxes. At least for macroalgae we have new numbers of biomass from the new paper by Kerstin, Lili and co-authors.  Phyto can be estimated for low productivity years and for high productivity years (see Irene s new paper)

we can also find a number for MPB with the help of Angela Wulff and presumably Kerstin and the benthic habitats.

Dear Francesca and Leo ,

we have here done a carbon budget for the PC sediments based largely on Patricks core data set. We have doen different sediment depth to get an estimate of fresh deposition 0-0.5 cm horizon, more persitent deposition in approx 2 -3 cm sed depth and then we have approximated the accumulated carbon in 12 cm sediment depth...

attached please find our first "carbon budget" for PC that shows a first approximation of carbon deposition (not burial) vs macroalgal annual production + the rest... IB ME, IBMA and EB MA


do we have any estimate, Fran, for ME + MA biomass in Faro, Creek and Isla that we could upscale to Corg / m2x cm layer?? The meiofauna is contained in the bulk carbon calculation... the bivalves are certainly not included... but are removed before the carbon is measured (at least Laternula).


Anyhow these are the first numbers that we can use for the carbon budget... I have no idea about the carbon from pelagic sources, but  Gaston says that he finds a lot of krill fecal pellets in the traps...

## Ulrike - How to calculate remineralization and Prokariotic Biomass 8/8/2017 

Hi Leo and Fran,
 
The way to convert oxygen consumption to carbon mineralization is by means of the respiratory quotient (O2 cons/DIC prod).
 
This ratio depends on the type of sediment: carbon mineralization in oxic sediments will be mainly through the consumption of oxygen, which is energetically the most energy efficient electron acceptor. Then the O2/DIC ratio ~1 (for every mole of O2 consumed, 1 mole of CO2 is produced). However, in sediments with less oxygen, such as the muddy sediments in Potter Cove, also anaerobic processes take place, and other electron acceptors are used (nitrate, sulfate, …), so the O2/DIC ratio becomes < 1.
 
The preliminary data we have, show very variable O2/DIC ratio’s, on average 0.6. So one has to divide SCOC by 0.6 to get to carbon mineralization (mmol C/m²/d).
 
Prokaryotic biomass:
 
The conversion of weight of sediment to surface, is by using porosity of the sediment (Volume porewater/Volume sediment) and sediment density (2.5 g/cm³) and integrating over the sediment column (5 cm):
 
Biomass/g of dry sediment * density [g/cm³]* (1 – porosity) [unitless]* height sediment column [cm] = biomass/cm² * 10 000 = biomass/m².
 
I think Fran should have the corresponding porosity values of those samples at 15m.
 
Cheers
 
Ulrike

Here are Dave s question written under the ppt he sent. I have given my answers in italics/times under it.., any more comments??

1. Most macroZooplankton and macrobenthos eat phytoplankton (as suspensión feeders) so need arrows from phytoplankton 

	>> yes.. but mostly the sinking material is undergoing detrius formation (mucuous, bacteria etc). We have some very detailed data on Laternula stomach content where everything is mixed... we made fotos.. I can send this to all. 

2. MacroZoo value looks v high to me (is it really the biggest standing stock of any of these components at Potter cove?) 

	>> we adressed this and Kerstin will adjust the Potter Cove water column so the value gets more realistic... still: the numbers will be too high. Solution???

3. The imbalance of primary being outweighed by secondary standing stock could be addressed by expressing it as increment per time (do we have enough turnover and growth data) – or do we think it is better to do as snapshot standing stock 

	>> respiration data to estimate C turnover by these species. 

4. Are fish in Potter Cove major consumers of macro-algae?  We had weeks of film of in situ fish behaviour at Signy Island and I never once saw any eating macro-algae; they seem to go for bentos and zooplankton (was it fatty acid / isotope work that lead to the arrow put in)?  I believe that fish do not feed on macroalgae
	
	>> ask Eugenia??  

5. Do no phytoplankton settle out to form detritus? YES!! the major pathway is PrimaryProduction >> DOC >> Bacterial Production (BP) 

	>> feeds higher trophic levels and feeds detritus pool (aggregate formation)

6. Ultimately I would think the dominant flow of energy is algae/animals - detritus – soft sediment prokaryotes (and protist eukaryotes).
